# search

Learning to search

Given a shape and a 2D space, this machine will search through the space for that shape, and produce transformation parameters for the tuple.

## Why?

Search is a basis of discovery. Any intelligent agent should be able to perform search. Unlike randomly picking up a solution and evaluating it, search should be systematic. An agent that successfully learned how to search should be able to find answer more efficiently in a given random space.
