# search

Learning to search
Learning to do policy gradient by policy gradient.

## Why?

Search is a basis of discovery. Any intelligent agent should be able to perform search. Unlike randomly picking up a solution and evaluating it, search should be systematic. An agent that successfully learned how to search should be able to find answer efficiently in a given random space. 

## Approach

tl,dr; a variational LSTM with policy-gradient on normal distribution.
